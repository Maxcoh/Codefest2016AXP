<br/>
####What is it?
AquiPhilly is an Android application that allows the community members to find rain water reserves in the local Philadelphia area.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
####Why?
The vision for this project came to the team when we were searching for local API's in the Philadelphia area.
After searching the API's the team decided that we wanted to do something different, something that could make a real difference.
In this day and age, resources are becoming more scarce and conservation of these resources is crucial. By bringing attention
to these water reserves we hope that we can motivate people to tap into these resources and cultivate a more
sustainable community, thus AquiPhilly was born.
